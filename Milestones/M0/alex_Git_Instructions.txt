Make sure before you start make sure you clone your repo

It will looks something like this

$ git clone https://github.com/CSC-648-SFSU/csc648-fall2019-Team04.git

Here are some instruction on how to create a new branch for tracking

First check to see what branch you are on and see if you have any conflicts

$ git status

if you are good to go, let's make you a branch

$ git branch -b [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]

Cool, you have a branch now. But Github doesn't know about it yet

Let's navigate to the 'Milestones' directory

Then go to one of the MileStones [M0-M5] (preferably the one we are working on now)

Make a file here and put some text in it

Cool, you made a change, congragulations!

Now we need to setup the remote repo

$ git remote add origin [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]

Time to push it, let's be lazy and do it in one line

$ git add . && git commit -m "Please put some meaningful message here" && git push

Cool, checkout github and refresh it. 

Let me know if you have problems
